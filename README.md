This app is designed to help users (specifically college users) quickly get information from large documents, manuals, research papers through an interactive chat experience.

### Problem

In my university, students struggle with understanding and retaining large amounts of course material. Basically there are large amount of course materials, all scattered everywhere. This issue is because of the lack of personalized study aids. Because of this, many students find it difficult to efficiently review their notes, ask relevant questions, and get clear explanations tailored to their specific needs.
